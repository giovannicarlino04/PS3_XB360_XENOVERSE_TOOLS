***** Error of linking on adding Q_OBJECT

Reponse from Dario:
"Hey there, I have a few very busy weeks so I won't be able to help too much for now. However, I can answer the Qt question pretty quickly.
Xenoviewer doesn't use QtCreator or qmake for code related to Qt, it just uses the MSVC2013 Solution. The Release version of Xenoviewer has configurations for all files related to Qt with Properties > Custom Build Tool. There the RCC, MOC, and UIC tools are called accordingly for all files as needed. All those moc_, ui_, and rcc files are autogenerated by these tools and don't need to be modified manually.
If you're having trouble with getting these files up to date, make sure to verify all these commands are there on each file that needs it.
I'm having trouble understanding most of the issues you described due to the sheer volume of the report, so asking more specific questions on individual issues would be preferred."
=> So check a old file with Q_OBJECT, and apply commandes on the new one :
-Configuration Properties-> General
	-Item Type : Custom Build Tool
	-Custom Build Tool->General
		-CommandLine: ..\..\depends\qt\bin\moc.exe %(RootDir)%(Directory)%(Filename).h -o %(RootDir)%(Directory)moc_%(Filename).cpp
		-Description: MOC
		-Output: %(RootDir)%(Directory)moc_%(Filename).cpp

-that will create a file moc_FileTreeItemWidget.cpp. you have to specify it into mocs.cpp.
-There is sommething to do, like a rebuild, may be a right click  on the file -> Compile, and after a rebuild of the project (and project witch depend on it).
-BECAREFULL : QTreeWidgetItem is not a QObject. you have to add it in heritage.
