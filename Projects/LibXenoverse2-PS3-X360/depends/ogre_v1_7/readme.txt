If we keep Ogre's sources is because we need it to debug Xenoviewer, 
and also add some custom automatic shader's parameter (autoNamed) to feat the Xenoverse's Shaders.



Keep in mind this :

-Dependencies are allready compiled. In Include and lib, there is all the result.
-if you want to modify dependencies, you could use Dependencies.sln, but you need to update by hand (or cmd) Include and lib folders

-solution for build Ogre_1.7 is into LibXenoverse.sln .
